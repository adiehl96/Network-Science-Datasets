# NIPS
This dataset describes a coauthorship network that has been curated from data of NIPS conference authors. The name of the conference has since been changed to NeurIPS.

## Origin
The dataset was described in a paper by [Miller et al. (2008)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2009/hash/437d7d1d97917cd627a34a6a0fb41136-Abstract.html). 
They in turn cite [Globerson et al. (2007)](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v8/globerson07a.html) for having accumulated the data from which Miller et al. have selected a subset. 
The links provided in these papers have since seized to work, so this can't be verified. 
The current version called [NIPS.csv](./NIPS.csv) has been found on the website of James Robert Lloyd, embedded in the [source code](https://jamesrobertlloyd.com/assets/BasicRFM.tar.gz) for a publication by [Lloyd et al. (2012)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/hash/df6c9756b2334cc5008c115486124bfe-Abstract.html)
