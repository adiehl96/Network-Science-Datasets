# HighSchool
The data in the HighSchool dataset describes the friendships between 247 12th graders.

## Origin
The data was first described in a paper by [Hoff (2007)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2007/hash/766ebcd59621e305170616ba3d3dac32-Abstract.html). In this paper, the authors have sourced the data from the "National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health", which includes information of close friendship ties between study participants. The authors mention a number of 247 participants, while the [official](https://doi.org/10.15139/S3/11900) number of participants in the study is approximately 6500. Hoff did not mention how he subsampled the data. The current version of the dataset called [HighSchool.csv](./HighSchool.csv) has been found on the website of James Robert Lloyd, embedded in the [source code](https://jamesrobertlloyd.com/assets/BasicRFM.tar.gz) for a publication by [Lloyd et al. (2012)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/hash/df6c9756b2334cc5008c115486124bfe-Abstract.html)
