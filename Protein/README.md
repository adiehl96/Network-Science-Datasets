# Protein


## Origin
The data was first described in a paper by [Hoff (2007)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2007/hash/766ebcd59621e305170616ba3d3dac32-Abstract.html). 

The current version of the dataset called [Protein.csv](./Protein.csv) has been found on the website of James Robert Lloyd, embedded in the [source code](https://jamesrobertlloyd.com/assets/BasicRFM.tar.gz) for a publication by [Lloyd et al. (2012)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/hash/df6c9756b2334cc5008c115486124bfe-Abstract.html)
